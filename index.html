        <h2>Web security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you adivise a potential 
            client to sucure his/her website from web security attacks? 
            Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
            <p id="web-security-answer">I would  say to my cilent is to have a vulnerabbility scanning tools or DAST "Dynamic Applictaion Seucrity Testing"that are used for scanning for securrity vulnerbaility 
                like cross-site scripting, Command injection, SQL injection and more to what type of security inprovment we can do before we lauch the website on the web.
                I also would advise them also useingn a effectiv password management to extra protection form potential attacker
                by haveing includeing your self made password also getting a one time use code that you will be send by SMS on your phone.
