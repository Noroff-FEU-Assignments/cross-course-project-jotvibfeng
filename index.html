        <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
        <h2>Web security</h2>
        <p id="web-security-question">How would you adivise a potential 
            client to sucure his/her website from web security attacks? 
            Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
            <p id="web-security-answer">The safety of the customer is the most important thing that we as front-end developers should focus on when we started working with a client and lucky there are many measures we can do to protect them from malicious attackers. 
                The first piece of advice I would give to my client is to have a vulnerability scanning tool or DAST "Dynamic Application Security Testing" that are used for scanning for security vulnerability like cross-site scripting, Command injection, SQL injection, and more 
                to determine what type of security measurements we must do so the user of the product can surf on the webe safely before we launch. 
                I also would advise them to use effective password management to protect from a potential attacker by having their self-made password and getting a one-time use code sent by SMS on their phone..
